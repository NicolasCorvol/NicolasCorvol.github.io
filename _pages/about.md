Welcome to my webpage!

I am a future PhD student at at Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées [CERMICS](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/) under the supervision of [Axel Parmentier](https://cermics.enpc.fr/~parmenta/), and industrial collaboration with Renault Group. I am working on Revenue Management for car dealership replenishment.

Before that, I graduated from Ecole Des Ponts ([ENPC](https://ecoledesponts.fr/)) and got a master’s degree in Operations Research ([MPRO](https://uma.ip-paris.fr/mpro)).
